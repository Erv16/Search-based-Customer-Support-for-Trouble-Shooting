If you know that the drive is working correctly, but it won't show up in File Explorer, the drive could be trying to use a letter already in use by another device or the drive letter may be missing.
The external hard drive itself, under normal circumstances, should be detected by your operating system, without the need of drivers, software, or firmware updates.
Verify the Seagate external hard drive light is blinking or not. No light means the power adapter is not connected to power.
If the drive is not detected in Disk Utility then see the System Information/System Profiler section.
